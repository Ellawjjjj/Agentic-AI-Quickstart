# Agentic-AI-Quickstart-From-LLM-to-Working-Agents
## 0. What is this repo?
This repository is a **quickstart knowledge base** for Agentic AI. The goal is to help you:
- Understand the core ideas (planning, memory, tool-use, safety, evaluation, cost/latency)
- Choose the right frameworks/tools (without getting lost in the ecosystem)
- Build a minimal working agent (MVP), then gradually make it more reliable and production-ready
